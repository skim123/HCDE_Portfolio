    Hello, My name is Sam Kim. I'm currently on the path to learn more about User Research and to become a User Researcher. I'm currently taking HCDE 598 to get some more programing experience under my belt. I hope that the projects that you see on this portfolio give you a good idea about the journey that I am to embark on.
