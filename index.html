    <h1>Sam Kim's HCDE Portfolio</h1>  
      <p>Hello, My name is Sam Kim. I'm currently on the path to learn 
       <p>more about User Research and to become a User Researcher. I'm</p>
       <p>currently taking HCDE 598 to get some more programing experience</p> 
       <p>under my belt. I hope that the projects that you see on this</p> 
       <p>portfolio give you a good idea about the journey that I am to embark on.</p>
