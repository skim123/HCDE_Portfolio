      <h1>Sam Kim's HCDE Portfolio</h1>  
        <p>Hello, My name is Sam Kim. I'm currently in the program to become a User
        Researcher by learning more about qualitative and quantitative research
        methods to improve the overall tech and human experience. I'm currently
        taking HCDE 598 to get some more programming experience under my belt.
        I hope that the projects that you see on this portfolio gives
        you a good idea about the journey that I am to embark on.</p>
